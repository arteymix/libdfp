    - sysdeps/s390/dfpu/fe\_decround.c (\_\_fe\_dec\_setround): Enable extended
      rounding modes (5,6 and 7) which are not covered by the standard.
   2011-1-18  Ryan S. Arnold  <rsa@us.ibm.com>
    - configure: Regenerated.
    - tests/test-isfinite.c: Changed expectation on isfinite() for
      negative numbers on Power5 to '1'.  Power6 (hardware isfinite) returns
      '-1' on isfinite.  The spec simply says that non-zero means finite.
    - tests/test-logd.c: Removed half completed 'quantize compare'
      functionality which was throwing a false error.
    - tests/test-decode.c: Removed dangling printf that wasn't useful.
    - tests/test-printf.c: Added a \_Decimal128 test for printing (1.0DL /
      1.000000e-123DL) which has a sufficiently negative exponent that it
      forced the 'index' (rounding digit) position to be negative and caused
      a segv when \_\_printf\_dfp() tried to erroneously round the result on
      s390.  We got lucky up until now on PowerPC due to the kernel
      reserving space on the top of the stack.
    - configure.ac: Incremented the version number to 1.0.6.
    - Versions.def: Incremented the version number to 1.0.6.
   2011-1-18  Andreas Krebbel  <Andreas.Krebbel@de.ibm.com>
    - printf\_dfp.c (\_\_printf\_dfp): Fixed segv where, if the exponent is
      sufficiently negative it pushes 'index' (the digit used to round
      values to the left) into a negative number.  In that case we simply
      don't need to round at all.
   2011-1-18  Ryan S. Arnold  <rsa@us.ibm.com>
    - tests/test-strtod.c: Adjusted assumptions of tests from truncation
      on too long of an input to rounding to nearest.
   2011-1-18  Andreas Krebbel  <Andreas.Krebbel@de.ibm.com>
    - strtod32.c (FUNCTION\_L\_INTERNAL): Check an extra digit on the input
      to see if we need to round rather than truncate.
   2011-1-17  Ryan S. Arnold  <rsa@us.ibm.com>
    - configure: Regenerated.
    - tests/test-strtod.c: Removed unnecessary test cases.
    - configure.ac: Incremented the version number to 1.0.5.
    - Versions.def: Incremented the version number to 1.0.5.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - Makefile.in (libdfp\_tests): Added test-log10d.
    - tests/test-decode.c: Added decode of log10d128(0.0000000011DL) to
      verify that it prints correctly in declets.
    - tests/test-logd.c (main): Added pbuf[CHAR\_MAX] so that tests work
      properly.
    - tests/test-log10d.c: New test-case which verifies that printf now
      works properly for the result of log10d128(0.0000000011DL).
    - sysdeps/dpd/dpd-private.c: Fixed dpd\_to\_char[0x3f4] from "974" to
      "774" since the previous was a typo which was making values print
      incorrectly.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - configure: Regenerated.
    - configure.ac: Removed addition of -fPIC to CFLAGS and instead export
      it to Makefile.in who is now responsible for adding it to CFLAGS.  Set
      (picflags): Default to -fpic since the GOT for libdfp should be small
      enough that -fPIC isn't needed.
    - Makefile.in: (BACKEND\_CFLAGS): New variable which passes -mcpu=foo
      and -fpic to the backend sub make invocation in -DEFS to get around
      the fact that libdecnumber/Makefile.in won't allow overridden CFLAGS.
    - sysdeps/dpd/dpd-private.c: Fixed 'used when uninitialized' warning
      by switching "else if" case to "else" for Decimal128.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - README.user: Added clarification of how to include dfp/math.h.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - dfp/math.h: Move #include\_next <math.h> so that if the compiler
      invocation has -I/<path>/include/dfp/ but doesn't define
      \_\_STDC\_WANT\_DEC\_FP\_\_ that they still get the system math.h.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - CONTRIBUTORS: Added Luis Machado.  Added DCO requirements.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - strtod32.c (FUNCTION\_L\_INTERNAL): Fix comparison operator.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - sysdeps/s390/dfpu/numdigits.h: Remove include guards.
    - sysdeps/powerpc/dfpu/numdigits.h: Likewise.
    - sysdeps/soft-dfp/dpd/numdigits.h: Likewise.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - tests/test-printf.c (printf\_d128s): Added 0.9999999999DL which
      reported 0.100000 rather than 1.000000 and was fixed by Andreas'
      patch from 2010-10-04.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - printf\_dfp.c (\_\_printf\_dfp): Fix up nd when rounding overflows
      beyond first digit.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - sysdeps/soft-dfp/floatsisd.c: Don't generate additional decimal
      digit.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - README.developer: Documentation update.
    - TODO: Mark some items as [DONE].

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - init\_dfp.c: Changed #include <dfp/dfp.h> to #include <dfp.h>.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - tests/test-amort.c: Added license and copyright.
    - tests/test-printf.c: Updated copyright year.
    - tests/test-strtod.c: Added license and copyright.  Corrected
      incorrect expected values.
    - strtod32.c: Fixed several conversion bugs.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - Makefile.in: Removed test-left\_justify from execution since it is a
      known failure case for non-power6 systems.  No worries since
      left\_justify isn't used right now.
    - tests/test-amort.c: Removed spurious #include <dfp.h>.
    - tests/test-get\_digits.c: Likewise.
    - tests/test-decode.c: Likewise.
    - tests/test-quantize.c: Likewise.
    - tests/test-printf.c: Likewise.
    - tests/test-fpclassify.c: Likewise.
    - tests/test-numdigits.c: Likewise.
    - tests/test-left\_justify.c: Likewise.
    - tests/test-isinf.c: Likewise.
    - tests/test-isnan.c: Likewise.
    - tests/test-isfinite.c: Likewise.
    - tests/test-strtod.c: Likewise.  Also changed one value compare test
      to a decode test since the visual representation was 0.0.
    - README.user: Added further user notes.
    - dfp/dfp.h: Moved this to ...
    - include/dfp.h: here since the user no longer has to call the
      printf\_dfp registration hooks, and thus doens't need the prototype.
       configure: Regenerated.
       configure.ac: Added AC\_SUBST(mzarch) back.  We shouldn't be editing
       CFLAGS.
       Makefile.in: Pass $(mzarch) along with CFLAGS if it is defined.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - configure: Regenerated.
    - Makefile.in: Added special sed script which changes
      libdecnumber/Makefile:CFLAGS = foo into CFLAGS ?= foo.  This allows
      libdfp/Makefile's sub make invocation of libdecnumber/Makefile to
      accept the updated CFLAGS.  This was necessary to allow configure to
      update CFLAGS with -mzarch for s390 z9-ec and z10.  GCC should fix
      this in their version of libdecnumber.
    - configure.ac: -mzarch added to CFLAGS when s390 system is z9-ec or
      z10.
    - README.developer: Added indication that configure.ac sets -mzarch in
      CFLAGS when appropriate.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - Makefile.gdb (libdfp\_tests.gdb): Add
      LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=./:$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH to ldd invocations to make sure
      it reports ./libdfp.so.1 as a dependency and not the system or
      toolchain libdfp.so.1.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - ieee754r/Versions: Added \_\_fabsd* and \_\_fpclassifyd* under the
      correct libdfp version number 1.0.3.

 - Miscellaneous changes

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - ieee754r/Versions: Moved some of the \_\_is* functions under LIBDFP\_1.0.2
      and LIBDFP\_1.0.3.  Removed unnecessary \_\_is* functions from export
      that don't have polymorphic versions in math.h
    - dfp/math.h: Removed accidental undef of isunordered.  This was
      never implemented as a polymorphic function because it doesn't need to
      be (per the spec).  Removed redundant polymoprhic isnan().
    - Versions.def: Added Versions LIBDFP\_1.0.2 and LIBDFP\_1.0.3 for Libdfp.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - configure: Regenerated.
    - configure.ac: Apparently AC\_CANONICAL\_SYSTEM is only for compilers.
      I removed it, and support for --target.  Now you must use --build
      only.
    - README.developer: Removed directions for using --target.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - sysdeps/powerpc/dfpu/fe\_decround.c (stdio.h): Removed unnecessary
      include.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - sysdeps/powerpc/dfpu/fe\_decround.c (\_\_fe\_dec\_getround): The
      structure which defined the DRN was to small and the compiler started
      generating code that wasn't properly extracting the DRN field from the
      structure holding the FPSCR value.  This is fixed.
    - tests/test-round.c: Testcase to prove fe\_dec\_getround() and
      fe\_dec\_setround().
    - Makefile.in (libdfp\_tests): Added test-round.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - configure: Regenerated.
    - config.log: Removed as unnecessary.
    - configure.ac: --target now works in lieu of --build.  --host is no
      longer necessary.
    - README.developer: Removed directive to use --host and replaced with a
      diective to use --target.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - configure: Regenerated file.
    - Makefile.in: Removed last comments dealing with -mzarch.
    - configure.ac: Removed last fragments dealing with -mzarch.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - ieee754r/isinfd32.c: Removed unnecessary static char buffer used for
      testing.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - ieee754r/isinfd32.c: Removed test-code that shouldn't have been
      checked in.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - ieee754r/isinfd32.c (isinf): Changed Infinity check such that
      DEC\_NAN doesn't pass as inf.  There was an incorrect mask check which
      was true for DEC\_NAN as well as Inf.
    - tests/test-isfinite.c: Added Conditional expectations for s390 for
      isfinite return values from negative number inputs.

 - Miscellaneous changes

      \_\_DEC[32|64|128]\_SUBNORMAL\_MIN\_\_.
    - tests/scaffold.c: Modified spacing in macro output for 'Success'.
    - tests/test-isfinite.c: Corrected expected values for negative
      numbers to return -1.  Corrected expected value for DEC\_NAN to '0'.
    - tests/test-strtod.c: Cleaned up.  Still failing.
    - sysdeps/powerpc/dfpu/fpclassifyd32.c (fpclassifyd32): Since
      \_Decimal32 is promoted to \_Decimal64 and \_\_DEC32\_SUBNORMAL\_MIN\_\_ falls
      within the bounds of \_Decimal64 a special case to range check for
      \_Decimal32 as required.
    - sysdeps/powerpc/dfpu/powd64.c: Whitespace correction.
    - strtod32.c: Started to cleanup the code.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - Makefile.in: Added test-numdigits, test-get\_digits, and test-left\_justify.

      by GCC 4.4.
    - base-math/lttd2.c (lttd3): Renamed lttd3 to lttd2.  Typo.
    - tests/test-get\_digits.c: Added test-cases to show previously failing
      numdigits for soft-dfp when coefficient was zero.  It was returning
      '0' intead of '1', which is what hardware DFP returns.
    - tests/test-printf.c: Added test-cases to show failing tests.
    - tests/test-fpclassify.c: (printf\_d32s): Changed DENORMAL to
      SUBNORMAL in constant usage.  GCC changed usage.

    - sysdeps/powerpc/dfpu/numdigits.h (\_NUMDIGITS\_H): Removed guard to
      allow multiple #includes with different preconditions.
      (numdigits): New implementation which avoids clobbers and avoids
      modifying a parameter.
      (left\_justify): New implementation which avoids clobbers and avoids
      modifyinig a parameter.
      (getexp): New implementation which avoids modifying a parameter.
    - sysdeps/powerpc/dfpu/fe\_decround.c (\_\_fe\_dec\_setround): Fixed
      errorneous usage of mtfsfi instruction.  Previous usage resulted in
      the set rounding mode not being permanent.
    - sysdeps/soft-dfp/dpd/numdigits.h (numdigits): Return '1' if
      coefficient is zero, which is what hardware DFP does.
      (\_\_dfp\_declet\_to\_dpd): Moved to ...
    - sysdeps/dpd/dpd-private.h: ... this file.
    - sysdeps/dpd/dpd-private.c: Formatting.
    - printf\_dfp.c (printf\_dfp): Major fixes to correct a variety of

    - README.user: New file.
    - README.developer: Updated to direct user to pass -m[31|32|64] in

    - Makefile.in: Replaced libdfp.so.1 generation using `ln -s' to using
      `ldconfig -l' in both $(top\_builddir)/ and $(install\_root)$(libdir)/.
      Added creation of linkname symlink libdfp.so.
      Strip trailing / from any install\_root=<foo> paths.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - Makefile.in: Fixed `ln -s' to not have the goofy '(cd..)', e.g. (cd
      $(libdir) ln -s <foo>) when making the .so.1 -> -1.0.1.so symlinks.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - Makefile.in: Fixed libdir=@prefix@/lib to libdir=@libdir@ and
      includedir=@prefix@/include to includedir=@includedir@.  This will
      allow configure override with --libdir= and --includedir=
      respectively.  This was preventing installation into /<foo>/lib64.
      Fix header install so that dfp/README isn't installed with the header
      files.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - Makefile.in: `install' doesn't handle symlinks so we've done another
      'ln -s' in the install stage to set $(SHARED\_LIBRARY) ->
      ./$(SHARED\_VERSIONED\_LIBRARY) in the $(install\_root)/$(libdir)/
      directory.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - Makefile.in: Fixed erroneous attempt to install libdfp.a even if
      --enable-static=no was configured.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - Makefile.in: Fixed missing libdecnumber.a rule dependency by
      changing the backend rule to be `libdecnumber.a' rather than
      `libdecnumber'.  Fixed `ln -s' error when rebuilding without a make
      clean by adding `-f' to always force overwrite the previous versioned
      library symlink.
    - README: Renamed to README.developer
    - README.developer: New file.

    - configure.ac: Added additional help text when warning about the
      glibc headers lacking the printf-hooks support.
    - README: Clarified version number.
    - TODO: Updated.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - configure: Regenerated.
    - configure.ac: Add check for glibc headers that support the

      --with-glibc-build.
    - TODO: Updated.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - configure: Regenerated.
    - configure.ac:  Updated libdfp to version 1.0.1 to indicate that
      power7 support has been added.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - configure: Regenerated.
    - configure.ac (AC\_CACHE\_CHECK): Re-added check for
      decimal-float-support in the compiler by checking whether the compiler
      can handle the \_Decimal64 data type rather than checking whether the
      compiler -v output had a particular flag set.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - configure: Regenerated.
    - configure.ac (AC\_PROG\_CC): Re-added AC\_PROG\_CC and removed custom
      $(CC).  Removed -m flags from CC and pushed this responsibility onto
      Makefile.in to put into CFLAGS.  These changes allow a user to prepend
      some custom flags onto CFLAGS at configure time.
      (dfp\_opts): Changed to $(cc\_mzarch).  No need to be obscure until we
      have to.
    - Makefile.in (cc\_mzarch): New variable used on s390 only, otherwise
      empty.
      (default\_cflags): Inherit defaults from configure.  Add

      -m$(cc\_msize) and $(cc\_mzarch).
      (+cflags): Simplified CFLAGS override mechanism.
      (+asflags): Simplified ASFLAGS override mechanism.
      ($(top\_builddir)/$(dfp\_backend)): Manually pass overridden CFLAGS to
      backend 'make' since the -m flags aren't passed in the top level
      configure's CFLAGS.
      ($(top\_builddir)/$(SHARED\_VERSION\_LIBRARY)): Added $(CFLAGS) since
      it's no longer part of $(CC).
      ($(libdfp\_tests)): Added $(CFLAGS) since it's no longer part of $(CC).

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - configure: Regenerated.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - configure.ac: Add -mzarch when building hw dfp on S/390.
      This is needed for 31 bit which would otherwise default to
      -mesa.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - configure: Regenerated.
    - Makefile.in (.c.o, .c.os): Added -include $(top\_builddir)/config.h to
      pick up \_BACKEND\_DPD or \_BACKEND\_BID.
      ($(top\_builddir)/$(STATIC\_LIBRARY)): Add $(top\_builddir) to
      dfp\_backend path.
    - README: Added WARNING about making sure to link to a glibc that's
      the same bitness (32|64) and the same optimization as the libdfp
      that's being configure.  Added --with-glibc-build= examples.

      (AC\_SUBST): CFLAGS and ASFLAGS.
      (AC\_CACHE\_CHECK): Removed check for compiler feature
      decimal-float-support.
    - ieee754r/frexpd32.c (INTERNAL\_FUNCTION\_NAME): Initialize 'result' to
      DEC\_NAN because compiler can't see that it's set in a macro and
      generates warnings.

    - tests/scaffold.c (\_DC, \_DC\_P): Added macros for testing against
      decoded[32|64|128] output.
    - tests/test-param.c (main): Updated to use scaffold.c and test the
      values against the decoded[32|64|128] values that're expected.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - ieee754r/powd32.c (INTERNAL\_FUNCTION\_NAME): Set \_\_isnan ->
      FUNC\_D(\_\_isnan).  Not strictly necessary since \_\_isnan is a
      polymorphic classification function, but this was we avoid the extra
      steps of detecting the type/size of the input parameter and call the
      appropriate \_\_isnand[32|64|128] directly.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - ieee754r/powd32.c: Add dfp prefix to \_\_isnan invocation.

 - Miscellaneous changes
    - sysdeps/s390/dfpu/fenv\_libdfp.h: Move file to ...

      --exec-prefix from setting @exec\_prefix@ to the string '$(prefix)',
      i.e. not the context of $prefix.
      ($(top\_builddir)/$(SHARED\_VERSION\_LIBRARY)): Added -W,no-whole-archive
      to close -W,whole-archive to SHARED\_VERSION\_LIBRARY rule.  Removed
      -nodefaultlibs -nostdlib which prevented linking against libc and libm
      which libdfp relies upon.
    - tests/test-printf.c (printf\_d128s): Added correct "expected"
      strings.
    - sysdeps/soft-dfp/dpd/numdigits.h (left\_justify): Changed erroneous
