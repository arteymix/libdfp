This directory is for anything that is soft-dfp specific, like rounding mode.

This directory also contains software emulated implementations of the
arithmetic, conversion, and classification routines.  These are normally
provided by libgcc but that library lacks floating point exception and
rounding mode support so we provide an override here.

The __dpd_ and __bid_ prefixed symbols are added to the 'Versions' scripts in
the dpd/ and bid/ directories respectively.

The Makefile only contains the files which aren't part of the base-math/
emulation, i.e. the binary->decimal and decimal->binary 'extend' and 'trunc'
functions.  Everything else is an override.
