Add tests/test-getexp to determine whether the hardware dfp version stores the
proper sign of the exponent with the stfiwx call.

Make get_digits calls use getexp_d* rather than computing the exponent
directly.

Upgrade libdecnumber version.
  Upgrade autoconf version
    Add @docdir@ to Makefile (supported in autoconf 2.6.0).

test make install headers with dfp/decimal/ headers.

Add testcase to verify soft-dfp TLS version of rounding mode functions.

Add printf_dfp test which change the rounding mode.

Add --with-cross feature to prevent the make check suite from being executed
on the build machine.

Add --export-test feature to export the test-suite into stand-alone static
test cases.

Finish make check test suite.

Clear up symbols and hidden symbol usage and export and make sure we aren't
using the PLT from within libdfp.

Optimize the math routines for hardware dfp support.

Implement dpd backend for x86 and x86_64.

Prototype versioned symbols support.

Implement libbid backend for x86_64.

[DONE] Configure runtime test for decimal floating point support in compiler.

[DONE] Configure test for glibc 2.10 headers.

[DONE] Configure runtime test for glibc 2.10 based on register_printf_type()
function..

[DONE] Write User's guide

[DONE] If system glibc is 2.10 then make check shouldn't need all the GLIBC build
scaffolding for executing and debugging tests.

[DONE] Clear up make clean 

[DONE] Work on make distclean.

[DONE] Clear up dependency issue so that libdfp.so.1 is rebuilt when a .c
file changes.
