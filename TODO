Configure test for NEEDED glibc 2.10

libdecnumber.so phantom library for compat issues

libdfp version issues with older apps.

If system glibc is 2.10 then make check shouldn't need all the GLIBC build
scaffolding.

Clear up make clean and make distclean

Clear up dependency issue so that libdfp.so.1 is rebuilt when a .c file
changes.

Finish make check test suite.

Clear up symbols and hidden symbol usage and export and make sure we aren't
using the PLT from within libdfp.

Optimize the math routines for hardware dfp support.

Implement libbid backend.
